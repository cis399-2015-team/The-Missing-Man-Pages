Shutting down one of the back-end httpd servers results in only one page serving requests through the load balancer.
This is made obvious when visting the domain of the load balancer by the PHP code in the index.php page.

Shutting down BOTH back-end servers immediately results in unserved requests.
Visiting the domain of the ELB after the unhealthy threshold is surpassed results in a blank page.

When an instance restarts the http daemon service it takes a few minutes for the load balancer to recognize the server as healthy and begin routing requests to it.
When the server is recognized and back in service, http requests are once again served by that instance through the load balancer.
When both servers come back on, http requests are split between instances as normal.
