http://missingmanpages-1289965409.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com

This is the domain name associated with the AWS Elastic Load Balancer for The Missing Man Pages.
The index.php file will be served by either of the two puppet instances, and displays a misleading message about which instance is serving pages.
This is due to problems with the PHP code in index.php. This could probably be solved by more carefully grabbing header information from the web server and determining hostname based on the IP forwarded to the ELB.
