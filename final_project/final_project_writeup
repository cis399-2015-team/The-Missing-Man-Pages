concrete goals for your project, and methods of testing and verification you will apply to determine whether those goals were met:


User Effect and Support:
This project will provide an easy to access interface for sending and receiving email. Because our email system is web browser based it will be accessible from most internet connected devices. Without such a feature users would have to send mail from the unix command line interface, or else use a different mail service. Because we have configured this email service ourselves we will have greater control over its use, which should allow us to give timely and detailed reports to clients and/or managers. 

Issues that may come up as we support this project are few, but critical nonetheless, because email is the primary means of business communications for many individuals. The first major support issue will involve maintaining user access at all times appropriate times to their email. This means we will need to ensure the system has very high stability. Other issues that may arise would be a user forgetting or losing their password and needing a new one issued, a similar event could be that a user’s email has been compromised and password changed, in which case we will need to lockdown that account until it’s access is restored to the appropriate owner of the account. In addition to maintaining high stability and accessibility of the system we will want to keep performance high. This will involve routine monitoring of the system to find problem areas, such as the server being overwhelmed by users that it needs additional resources to spin up emails in a timely manner, for this some sort of dynamic resource allocation would be handy or a load balancer setup. Routine auditing of storage usage will help identify users who have not archived or deleted email regularly enough. In these cases we will simply suggest that they heaviest user archive or delete their older emails to free up more storage space for the rest of the user base.
