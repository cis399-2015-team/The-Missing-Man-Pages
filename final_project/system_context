The Missing Man Pages team has deployed webmail services on three AWS EC2 instances loaded with the standard Ubuntu AMI.

Webmail services depend on several software systems.
These include:
  Roundcube Webmail (Front end interface)
  MySQL (Database Service)
  Dovecot (IMAP Service)
  Sendmail (Mail Services)
  PAM (User Authentication)
  PHP (Specifically php5-cgi and php5-fpm)
  Memcached (Memcached and php5-memcache, for session storage, attachment storage and performance increase)
  
The instance that holds the master database records has a different system context.
The master database server has the following system requirements:
  MySQL: This is the most important piece of software on the master database server (except perhaps puppet)
         The master server must have a running MySQL service, which must be allowed to communicate with the
         other two servers via the default MySQL port.
         This server must hold the database records for webmail services.  Roundcube provides a database initialization
         file specifically for MySQL.  This file must be loaded into the roundcubemail database and grants must be
         given to the front-end server's private IP.
