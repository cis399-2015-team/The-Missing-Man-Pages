The purpose of this installation document is to allow the Arch Linux system on the Missing Man Pages subnet of EC2 to be:
	> Recreated in the event of a disaster
	> Duplicated with consistent configurations between installations
	> Explained to and understood by fellow system admins

Getting Started:
	1) Launch an instance in EC2
		> Use the lab-cloud network, and the Missing Man Pages subnet
		> Create a key-pair or use your existing key-pair and .pem file
		> Do not proceed without the .pem file for your key-pair
	2) Connect to the instance (SSH)
		> Get the public DNS name of the instance (this will be used to SSH)
		> Locate the private key file (.pem) and note the full path of the file
		> Run chmod to modify the permissions on your private key file: chmod 400 example-key-pair.pem
		> Run SSH with the private key file to connect to the public DNS with this command:
			ssh -i /path/to/example-key-pair.pem root@public_dns_full_name
			Note: The actual path and dns name should be filled in by administrator
		> You should now be connected to the instance.  If the connection is rejected,
			recheck that the public dns name is correct, and that the .pem file is where you claim.
		> You now have root access to the Arch Linux instance that was launched.

Root Configurations:
	1) Changing the hostname
		> Run this command to change the hostname in /etc/hostname:
			hostnamectl set-hostname Arch64EC2
		> Make sure it worked:
			cat /etc/hostname
		> Add the same hostname to the /etc/hosts file.
			nano /etc/hosts
			*add the hostname to the file*
			Hit ctrl-x and type "y" to confirm file change.
		> Reboot the system and reconnect (you will be allowed to connect when the status checks are complete)
			reboot
			ssh -i /path/to/example-key-pair.pem root@public_dns_name
	2) Package management
		> Setting up access to Arch User Repositories requires editing some text files.
		> Edit the pacman.conf file with the following command:
			nano /etc/pacman.conf
			*Add the following lines to the bottom of the text file*
			[archlinuxfr]
			SigLevel = Never
			Server = http://repo.archlinux.fr/$arch
		> Install the "Yet AnOther User Repository Tool" (YAOURT) and some other goodies:
			pacman -S yaourt net-tools bash-completion archey3 firefox ttf-dejavu ttf-droid ttf-inconsolata
	3) Adding a user
